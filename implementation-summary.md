## üîç Feature 1: Repeated Words Analysis

### Implementation Details
- **Pure client-side processing** - No server required
- **Real-time analysis** when enabled by user
- **Customizable stop-word filtering** with comprehensive English stop words list
- **Top 15 most frequent words** display with counts and percentages
- **Visual progress bars** for word frequency representation

### User Interface
- Toggle button to show/hide analysis in results section
- Separate toggle for including/excluding common words (stop words)
- Compact display with word counts and visual frequency indicators
- Statistics showing total unique words and most repeated word count

### Technical Features
- Handles punctuation removal and case normalization
- Filters out single-character words
- Percentage calculations based on filtered word totals
- Integrated with existing word counting infrastructure
- Memory efficient with Map-based frequency counting

## üåê Feature 2: CORS Fix for Website Fetching

### Implementation Details
- **Multiple proxy services** with automatic fallback
- **Direct fetch attempt first** for sites without CORS restrictions
- **Robust error handling** with specific, user-friendly messages
- **Support for different proxy response formats**

### Proxy Services Implemented
1. **AllOrigins.win** - Primary proxy with JSON response handling
2. **CorsProxy.io** - Secondary proxy for additional reliability
3. **CORS Anywhere** - Tertiary fallback option

### Error Handling Improvements
- Specific error messages for different failure types
- Helpful suggestions for users when all proxies fail
- Graceful degradation with clear explanations
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing error states

### Technical Features
- Automatic proxy service rotation on failure
- Response format detection and parsing
- Enhanced HTML content extraction and cleaning
- Better whitespace normalization and text cleanup

## üìÑ Feature 3: OCR for PDF

### Implementation Details
- **Tesseract.js integration** for client-side OCR processing
- **Automatic fallback logic** when standard PDF text extraction fails
- **Multi-language support** with 10 common languages
- **Real-time progress tracking** with visual progress bar
- **High-quality image rendering** for better OCR accuracy

### OCR Process Flow
1. **Standard Text Extraction** - Attempts regular PDF.js text extraction first
2. **Fallback Detection** - Triggers OCR if less than 50 characters extracted
3. **PDF to Image Conversion** - Renders PDF pages as high-resolution canvas elements
4. **OCR Processing** - Uses Tesseract.js with progress callbacks
5. **Text Aggregation** - Combines all page results with proper formatting

### Language Support
- English (default)
- Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese
- Russian, Chinese (Simplified), Japanese, Korean
- User-selectable language before file upload

### User Experience Features
- **Progress indicator** showing OCR completion percentage
- **Language selection dropdown** for optimal recognition
- **Non-blocking UI** - Other features remain available during OCR
- **Graceful error handling** with fallback error messages
- **Automatic cleanup** of OCR workers and resources

### Technical Optimizations
- **2x scale rendering** for improved OCR accuracy
- **Canvas-based image processing** for memory efficiency
- **Per-page error handling** - continues processing if individual pages fail
- **Worker termination** - proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Progress reserving** - shows realistic progress throughout process

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "tesseract.js": "^6.0.1"  // OCR functionality
}
```

### State Management Additions
- `showRepeatedWords`: Toggle for word analysis display
- `filterStopWords`: Toggle for stop word filtering
- `ocrProgress`: Progress tracking for OCR operations
- `isOcrProcessing`: Loading state for OCR operations
- `ocrLanguage`: Selected language for OCR processing

### New Functions Implemented
- `analyzeRepeatedWords()`: Core word frequency analysis
- `extractTextWithOCR()`: OCR processing with progress tracking
- `convertPDFPageToImage()`: PDF page to canvas conversion
- `parseHTML()`: Separated HTML parsing for reusability
- Enhanced `extractTextFromWebpage()`: Multi-proxy implementation
- Enhanced `extractTextFromPDF()`: OCR fallback integration

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Build Status
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ Vite production build successful
- ‚úÖ PWA generation successful
- ‚úÖ All features integrated without conflicts

### Feature Testing
- ‚úÖ Repeated words analysis with various text inputs

## üöÄ Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- **Client-side processing** - No server dependencies for core features
- **Lazy loading** - OCR workers only created when needed
- **Memory management** - Proper cleanup of canvas elements and workers
- **Progressive enhancement** - Features work independently
- **Fallback logic** - Graceful degradation when services fail

### Bundle Size Impact
- Added ~18KB for Tesseract.js core (gzipped)
- OCR models loaded on-demand by language
- No impact on initial page load performance
- Progressive loading of OCR resources

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancement Opportunities
